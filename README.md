ArtisanAura – Full‑Stack E‑commerce (Monorepo)

Overview

ArtisanAura is a full‑stack e‑commerce application built with a Node.js/Express + MongoDB backend and a React (Vite) + Tailwind frontend. It supports product management, authentication with JWT + refresh tokens, checkout with Stripe, order management for buyers and sellers, reviews, a simple admin area, a help desk flow, and an image‑aware chatbot (Gemini API) to assist users.

Repository structure

- backend – Express API, MongoDB models, services, and routes
- frontend – React app (Vite + Tailwind)

Key features

- Authentication: Register, login, refresh token rotation via HTTP‑only cookie; protected routes via Bearer token
- Products: Create, update, delete, search, category browsing, per‑seller listing; image uploads with Multer, served from /uploads
- Checkout: Stripe checkout session creation and post‑payment order confirmation
- Orders: Buyer and seller views, analytics and stats for sellers
- Reviews: Product and shop reviews with optional images
- Shops: Public shop pages and seller shop profiles
- Admin: Users, products, orders, reviews, and help requests management
- Help desk: Users can open help tickets; admins can review and update status
- Chatbot: Gemini model integration with optional image prompts

Tech stack

- Backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, JWT, Multer, Nodemailer, Stripe
- Frontend: React 19, React Router, Axios, Vite, Tailwind CSS

Quick start

1) Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm or yarn
- A MongoDB connection string
- Stripe account (for checkout)
- Google Generative AI (Gemini) API key (for chatbot)

2) Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> artisanaura
cd artisanaura

# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3) Configure environment

Create a .env file in backend with the following keys:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<host>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
NODE_ENV=development

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx

# Mail (Nodemailer)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.yourprovider.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_user
SMTP_PASS=your_password
MAIL_FROM=no-reply@artisanaura.local
# Optional: use ethereal for testing (auto-creates test account)
ENABLE_ETHEREAL=false

# Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
```

4) Run the apps

```bash
# In one terminal
cd backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

- Backend runs on http://localhost:3000
- Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173

Configuration notes

- CORS: Backend currently allows origin http://localhost:5173 with credentials enabled.
- Static uploads: Backend serves files from /uploads; product/review routes accept images via Multer.
- API base URL: Frontend uses http://localhost:3000/api (see frontend/src/api/client.js). Refresh token endpoint is /api/refresh.

Scripts

Backend (package.json):

- npm run dev – Start with nodemon on PORT (defaults to 3000)
- npm start – Start with node

Frontend (package.json):

- npm run dev – Start Vite dev server
- npm run build – Build for production
- npm run preview – Preview the built app
- npm run lint – Lint the codebase

Authentication flow

- Login returns a short‑lived access token (stored in localStorage by the frontend) and sets an HTTP‑only refresh cookie.
- Frontend attaches Authorization: Bearer <access> to requests. On 401, it automatically calls /api/refresh to obtain a new access token.
- Refresh cookie is cleared on logout; logout‑all bumps token version to invalidate other sessions.

File uploads

- Product creation/update uses upload.single('image')
- Reviews use upload.array('images', 4)
- Uploaded files are served from GET /uploads/<filename>

Email

- Outbound mail via SMTP (configure SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS and MAIL_FROM). Set ENABLE_ETHEREAL=true to use Ethereal for local testing.

Chatbot

- Configure GEMINI_API_KEY and optional GEMINI_MODEL. Endpoint: POST /api/chatbot/chat (supports text and up to 3 images).

Production notes

- Set NODE_ENV=production to enable secure cookie settings.
- Configure CORS origin to your deployed frontend URL in backend/index.js.
- Ensure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and all JWT secrets are set via environment variables.
- Serve frontend separately (e.g., static hosting) and point it to your backend API base URL.

Troubleshooting

- 401 responses: Ensure JWT_SECRET/REFRESH secret values are set and consistent; confirm refresh cookie domain/path in browser.
- Mongo connection errors: Verify MONGODB_URI and that your IP is whitelisted (Atlas).
- Stripe errors: Confirm STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and that the price/product IDs passed from frontend exist.
- Image uploads fail: Check that the backend has write access to backend/uploads and that requests use the correct form field names.
